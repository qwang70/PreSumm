while the assortment was good , and i did get this on a gold box purchase , the price for this was <br /> $ 3-4 less at target.this bag of candy online is pretty expensive , it should be cheaper in order to compete with grocery stores , other than that , its a good combination of my favorite candy<q>i love the quality of this product and it was much less expensive than the local store 's candy.it is chocolate , what can i say .<q>arrived before halloween as indicated and was enough to satisfy trick or treaters .

the coffee was smooth tasting .<q>as maxwell coffee once advertised " good to the last drop " , thats what i found with this coffee .<q>i did n't experience any bitterness or off taste .

<br /> so far , the only coconut water that i have found , that is n't paturized , is made by exotic superfoods .<q>really taste great ... but i just called the company , taste nirvana , and they confirmed that their coconut water is indeed pasturized .<q>so i 'm looking to find where to purchase exotic superfoods coconut water .

really enjoyed these and whats great is that these have half the salt of brunswick kippersi used to eat these when i was a kid and loved them .<q>not king oscar.these are great quality kippers and the cans have never given me any trouble whatsoever .<q><br /> <br /> this is the fifth time in 2 weeks this has happened and you would think that i would have learned my lesson .

no worse price wise than starbucks or peets .<q>as a peets coffee fanatics we learned that weavers roaster was the roaster for peet 's and we are hooked !<q>i am running through the list of types they have looking for a favorite and have n't found one yet , they 're all so darned smooth .

i originally found this roasted garlic juice at one of those roadside shops that sell a variety of foodstuffs , plants and ice cream .<q>that was about a year ago and unfortunately , the place is now out of business .<q>it is pungent yet smooth and will bring out the flavor in any meat or dish you can imagine .

kettle chips are great chips f/the money!after buying bags one at a time ( at a hefty markup ) at nearby stores , i decided to try bulk ordering some snack foods on amazon .<q>i like the sweet onion chips better , but these are also at the top of the list for great-tasting potato chips .<q>salt & vinegar flavor is satisfying , about an 8 out of 10 .

<br /> <br /> very light and crispy -- and a perfect snack at 30 calories each , with no sodium or cholesterol!i found these in bags in the supermarket and fell in love with them .<q>buying them in bulk saves as much as a $ 1.20 per box but the taste is n't as good .<q>they are healthy and delicious !

best dog food on the market today .<q>my cocker loves the food too!this is food especially designed for cocker spaniels who have a range of health issues ... i have been using this product with three of my dogs and all of them are very happy with it .<q>had numerous ear problems with our cocker spaniel and they have cleared up since taking this food.my father could no longer take care of his beloved 6 year old cocker spaniel , so i decided to take her into my family .

among the best milk chocolate candy i 've eaten -- ranks with the pricey kind for taste and texture .<q>would buy again.these are chocolate bars that are no longer on the open market .<q>amazon has it and the candy is very tasty and well worth the price .
11
someone has produced bottled lime and lemon juice that taste like fresh juice !<q>keeps about a year after opening .<q><br /> <br /> the juice is 100 % organic and not from concentrate , and each one is pure juice with nothing whatsoever added .
12
you add your own veggies and meat .<q>the sauce is thick and somewhat spicy .<q>this product is of good quality .
13
soft , sweet , chewy , superb .<q>they are great for people who are trying to watch what they eat or are perfect for small hands .<q><br /> <br /> note : these cookies do contain egg , soy and coconut ingredients and are " manufactured on shared equipment with milk , wheat , peanut and other tree nut containing products . "

for a really great bulk olive mix , try the vigo mixed olives also on amazon.i was hosting a large party and decided to get this bulk package from amazon - both for cooking and for serving as apps .<q>the mix had mostly green olives , quite a few olives were mashed .<q>i used in roasted potatoes w/garlic & parsley ; pasta sauce , picadillo , & to make spicy herbed olive dishes for christmas .

my son started using it around six months , and he really enjoys it .<q>i tried scrubbing them out and even washed it in the dishwasher as it suggests.i loved this product for fruits and other food that i did n't want my new baby to choke on .<q>the only drawback is that bits of food get stuck in the mesh and the seams and are impossible to get out .
16
the tuna , tomato combination is delicious .<q>the tuna tastes like it 's good quality but i found the tomato basil flavor to be a bit bland .<q>it 's still a great option for a low calorie , low fat meal.i found it much tastier than the plain tuna pouches out there .
17
i love the oatmeal , the banana walnut and cranberry flax bars .<q>corazonas has a " just right " taste and texture i love.i bought these as a healthier substitute for the breakfast bars that i usually have in the morning .<q>they are also a delicious and portable snack for later in the day .

great stuff.these are the best tasting tortilla chips i have ever had !<q>of course , kettle chips are just good chips - they use good oil to make them and even the plain ones are tasty .<q>these are easily some of the most spicy chips you will ever eat , but oompletely enjoyable .
