<a name="1">[1]</a> <a href="#1" id=1>i bought a set of two when my son was about 6 months , and we started taking them with us whenever we went to eat</a>
<a name="2">[2]</a> <a href="#2" id=2>i did n't have to be overly worried about him choking on big chunks , and he got to try out new foods</a>
<a name="3">[3]</a> <a href="#3" id=3>i tried scrubbing them out and even washed it in the dishwasher as it suggests</a>
