[CLS] really enjoyed these and what ##s great is that these have half the salt of brunswick ki ##pper ##si used to eat these when i was a kid and loved them . [SEP] [CLS] you ' ##d open the can and there would be two or three whole , fl ##ak ##y fill ##ets inside with the skin still on . [SEP] [CLS] perhaps i got a bad can this time , but these were just awful . [SEP] [CLS] like opening a can of cat food . [SEP] [CLS] an un ##ide ##nti ##fia ##ble mass of smashed fish meat . [SEP] [CLS] ic ##k ##. ##af ##ter the pop ##- ##top ring came off i used some offset pl ##iers to open the can , which was not only difficult it ended up sp ##lat ##tering the liquid inside all over my desk . [SEP] [CLS] once inside the ki ##pper ##s were so ##ggy , courtesy of much too much water . [SEP] [CLS] < ##br / ##> < ##br / ##> this is the fifth time in 2 weeks this has happened and you would think that i would have learned my lesson . [SEP] [CLS] i suppose i am now convinced that it is definitely not an anomaly . [SEP] [CLS] fortunately i only have three cans left before i become an ex ##- ##cus ##tom ##er of this product . [SEP] [CLS] < ##br / ##> < ##br / ##> they used to be a decent product . [SEP] [CLS] but they have gone to hell big time . [SEP] [CLS] 09 ##/ ##19 ##/ ##20 ##12 ##one can not find a better ki ##pper snack . [SEP] [CLS] and , they are healthy for you . [SEP] [CLS] other brands taste watered down . [SEP] [CLS] not king oscar ##. ##thes ##e are great quality ki ##pper ##s and the cans have never given me any trouble whatsoever . [SEP] [CLS] usually i get a better deal going bulk with amazon than i do from my local grocery store too . [SEP] [CLS] i do n ##' ##t mind the salt and do appreciate the omega 3 ' ##s . [SEP] [CLS] twice ( at least ) the salt of season ki ##pper snacks , those with or without salt . [SEP] [CLS] not nearly as good ##. ##and slightly less ki ##pper ##s per can ##. ##dis ##app ##oint ##ing taste .

[CLS] really taste great ... but i just called the company , taste nirvana , and they confirmed that their coconut water is indeed past ##urized . [SEP] [CLS] what a shame , as the heat kills all the wonderful nutrients . [SEP] [CLS] < ##br / ##> so far , the only coconut water that i have found , that is n ##' ##t pat ##urized , is made by exotic super ##fo ##ods . [SEP] [CLS] so i ' ##m looking to find where to purchase exotic super ##fo ##ods coconut water . [SEP] [CLS] < ##br / ##> i wish it were available here on amazon ##. ##tas ##tes way better than vita coco and z ##ico . [SEP] [CLS] the best way to describe it is fresh ##er and sweet ##er , without any packaging tastes that the others contain ( thanks to taste nirvana using glass . ) [SEP] [CLS] < ##br / ##> < ##br / ##> the only alternative is to crack open a coconut yourself . [SEP] [CLS] which i do , but i ca n ##' ##t do daily ##. ##ex ##tre ##mel ##y good for not being raw and being bottled ##/ ##can ##ned . [SEP] [CLS] i have had better , but only raw in the nut . [SEP] [CLS] i have had equal , but only in bottles from other boutique brands or labeled " raw " but in the bottle . [SEP] [CLS] i wo n ##' ##t even buy naked or one anymore , just to weak and stale , poor remnants of their fresh se ##lves . [SEP] [CLS] disclosure : i ' ##ve bought mine of this brand elsewhere , but am glad to see it here for easier access and am ordering now . [SEP] [CLS] this is fantastic for being available on amazon ##! ##i absolutely love this coconut water . [SEP] [CLS] i can drink other brands if the water is flavor ##ed with something else , but this water is great in its natural flavor state .

[CLS] if you ' ##ve tried the conventional kettle cr ##ink ##le chip ve ##rson salt and pep ##er , you ca n ##' ##t compare these to those ! [SEP] [CLS] these are easily some of the most spicy chips you will ever eat , but o ##omp ##lete ##ly enjoyable . [SEP] [CLS] you finish the bag and the ind ##side is just coated with spices . [SEP] [CLS] great stuff ##. ##thes ##e are the best tasting tor ##till ##a chips i have ever had ! [SEP] [CLS] i have become allergic to tomatoes , but i love tor ##till ##a chips . [SEP] [CLS] there is so much flavor in these chips that i no longer miss pic ##o de gallo . [SEP] [CLS] i prefer to eat them plain . [SEP] [CLS] they also have just the right amount of heat to make them fl ##ovo ##rf ##ul , but not over ##powering ##ly spicy ##. ##thes ##e potato chips are delicious ! [SEP] [CLS] i have not had potato chips in approximately two years as it has been difficult to find organic chips . [SEP] [CLS] amazon lowered the price on these , and i finally had a chance to order them . [SEP] [CLS] i most definitely will be ordering them again ! [SEP] [CLS] my family and i love them . [SEP] [CLS] they are pure and void of all artificial flavor ##ings . [SEP] [CLS] the true flavor is present , and it sat ##isi ##fies the need for something salty , sweet , spicy , and crunch ##y . [SEP] [CLS] a + + + + these chips are a great snack if you do n ##' ##t want all the junk ass ##icia ##ted with chips . [SEP] [CLS] try them you ' ##ll like them ##. ##i love these chips . [SEP] [CLS] the flavor is not plain . [SEP] [CLS] they are sweet and spicy all at the same time . [SEP] [CLS] the only draw ##back is it has a tad bit too much salt . [SEP] [CLS] but , it still a great flavor ##! ##thes ##edo ##n ' t like hot food they might be a bit much for you . [SEP] [CLS] they have a great balance of sweetness and spice . [SEP] [CLS] of course , kettle chips are just good chips - they use good oil to make them and even the plain ones are ta ##sty . [SEP] [CLS] i also like that they are ridge ##d chips - those are usually too crunch ##y and hard to chew for me - i do n ##' ##t want to have to work that hard for my delicious ##ness . [SEP] [CLS] if you like spicy barbecue you will definitely like these chips ##. ##just the right amount of spice to make them hot and they are also sweet ! [SEP] [CLS] very hard to find in new jersey . [SEP]

[CLS] i ' ##ve gotten to try similar twists from a well known food retailer that we do n ##' ##t have in the houston area . [SEP] [CLS] thank goodness i found these online - ##- they ' ##re exactly the same , and what an awesome price ! [SEP] [CLS] < ##br / ##> < ##br / ##> very light and crisp ##y - ##- and a perfect snack at 30 cal ##ories each , with no sodium or cho ##les ##terol ##! ##i found these in bags in the supermarket and fell in love with them . [SEP] [CLS] they are healthy and delicious ! [SEP] [CLS] only problem with the boxed ones is they are smaller and harder than the ones you buy in the market . [SEP] [CLS] buying them in bulk saves as much as a $ 1 ##. ##20 per box but the taste is n ##' ##t as good . [SEP] [CLS] so , i ' ##ve gone back to buying them in the store . [SEP] [CLS] only other suggestion could be that they might be just as good with slightly less sugar even though the sugar content is low . [SEP] [CLS] all that aside , i ' ##ve gotten about 20 people addicted to them as i am . [SEP] [CLS] one of the best tasting products on the market and healthy . [SEP] [CLS] < ##a hr ##ef ##= ##" ##ht ##tp ##: ##/ ##/ ##w ##w ##w ##. ##ama ##zon ##. ##com ##/ ##gp ##/ ##pro ##du ##ct ##/ ##b ##00 ##0 ##i ##6 ##k ##q ##8 ##w ##" ##> barry ' ##s bakery french twist , original , 4 ##. ##5 ##- ##oun ##ce box ( pack of 12 ) < ##/ ##a ##> an excellent choice when you want a sweet treat that is low in sugar . [SEP] [CLS] these light crisp ##y little twists fit well into a low sugar plan and are great with hot or iced tea , too ##! ##thes ##e french twists taste so good that it ' ##s hard to believe they ' ##re not un ##hea ##lth ##y ! [SEP] [CLS] i love them - they fit into any diet plan and taste sweet , despite not having excessive amounts of sugar ##. ##the quality of the twist was its usual good quality , but they would have survived the transport much better had they been in the plastic tub ##s , as advertised and as we have been used to getting them while they were still available locally . [SEP] [CLS] the other plus for the plastic container is its value as a container after the twists are gone ##. ##i thought i was ordering 12 boxes of the larger twists , which come individually wrapped and are 60 cal ##ories each . [SEP] [CLS] however , i received 12 boxes each containing a bag filled with small 30 ##- ##cal ##ori ##e twists . [SEP]

[CLS] this product is of good quality . [SEP] [CLS] the sauce is thick and somewhat spicy . [SEP] [CLS] i made it with pre ##- ##co ##oked shrimp for a quick meal . [SEP] [CLS] it would be equally good with to ##fu or chicken . [SEP] [CLS] it is just 2 serving ##s at best but you can always add more noodles of your own ##. ##i found it very helpful to disregard the directions and simply put the noodles in a dish with water and microwave for about three minutes . [SEP] [CLS] add sauce < ##br / ##> < ##br / ##> and eat . [SEP] [CLS] i find it to be a wonderful lunch ##time meal ##. ##thi ##s is a very easy , ta ##sty meal for two . [SEP] [CLS] it has a significant amount of " heat , " so if you do n ##' ##t like " spicy , " you probably want to skip this . [SEP] [CLS] for me , it was just about perfect . [SEP] [CLS] < ##br / ##> < ##br / ##> it comes with rice noodles and stir ##- ##fr ##y sauce . [SEP] [CLS] you add your own ve ##gg ##ies and meat . [SEP] [CLS] my favorite combination is shrimp , carrot ##s , red bell pepper , and either snow peas or just some frozen green peas ( ok , i know that ' ##s not " authentic ##ally " asian , but it tastes good ... ) . [SEP] [CLS] you so ##ak the noodles for 3 minutes in hot water , stir fry the protein ( shrimp , chicken , whatever ) in the sauce for a minute or two , add the ve ##gg ##ies and stir for another minute or two , then mix in the softened noodles . [SEP] [CLS] divide onto two plates , and you ' ##re ready to eat . [SEP] [CLS] < ##br / ##> < ##br / ##> this is n ##' ##t too salty - ##- some asian sauce ##s taste like soy sauce with a hint of other flavor ##ings , but not this one . [SEP] [CLS] it ' ##s full of citrus flavor ( mostly orange ) , slightly sweet , with that punch of heat . [SEP] [CLS] < ##br / ##> < ##br / ##> will buy again ##! ##thes ##e noodles are ta ##sty , my family and i like them . [SEP] [CLS] i add sa ##ute ##ed vegetables and to ##fu for a full meal . [SEP] [CLS] the taste is spicy but we like it that way . [SEP] [CLS] the citrus flavor is better than the peanut which is too bland i think . [SEP] [CLS] i ' ##ll re ##ord ##er it when we are out ... i bought this product with much suspicion but it turned out to be perfect ! [SEP] [CLS] i love the spicy ##ness

[CLS] arrived before halloween as indicated and was enough to satisfy trick or treat ##ers . [SEP] [CLS] i love the quality of this product and it was much less expensive than the local store ' ##s candy ##. ##it is chocolate , what can i say .

[CLS] i agree with the previous reviewer about the bland ##ness of this coffee . [SEP] [CLS] it had no acid ##ity or backbone at all . [SEP] [CLS] very weak flavor and the cho ##co ##- ##bro ##wn ##ie flavor ##ing just was n ##' ##t my thing ( thought i ' ##d never meet a brown ##ie i did n ##' ##t like ) . [SEP] [CLS] that said , i really like the cameron ' ##s organic french roast ... pretty much the polar opposite from this coffee , maybe even too strong for some ##. ##i am on the sub ##scribe and save program for this coffee and have been buying it for a while now . [SEP] [CLS] the coffee was smooth tasting . [SEP] [CLS] i did n ##' ##t experience any bitterness or off taste . [SEP] [CLS] i found it naturally easy to drink . [SEP] [CLS] as maxwell coffee once advertised " good to the last drop " , that ##s what i found with this coffee . [SEP] [CLS] the aroma was nice too ##. ##i expected a ta ##sty dessert coffee but flavor remained bland no matter how strong i tried to make it .

[CLS] best dog food on the market today . [SEP] [CLS] had numerous ear problems with our cock ##er span ##iel and they have cleared up since taking this food ##. ##my father could no longer take care of his beloved 6 year old cock ##er span ##iel , so i decided to take her into my family . [SEP] [CLS] when i brought her to nyc she had ear and eye discharge . [SEP] [CLS] she was also slightly over ##weight . [SEP] [CLS] after a check up with a vet that ruled out infection , i decided to try royal can ##in based on the numerous good reviews ##. ##with ##in a week her ear and eye problems were gone and she dropped a good amount of weight . [SEP] [CLS] this is going to be the only food that we will be feeding her ##! ##our span ##iel has tried several foods in her 6 years , and this is the only one she will eat by itself without any " people food " being added ( of course , we still treat her occasionally ) . [SEP] [CLS] when we went in for our 12 month tooth ##- ##cle ##ani ##ng appointment , the vet told us to take her home as her teeth did n ##' ##t need any cleaning for another 6 months , at least . [SEP] [CLS] it is specially designed for their teeth and health needs , and she loves it . [SEP] [CLS] and it is actually cheaper here than at the fancy pet store ! [SEP] [CLS] what more could you ask ##? ##roy ##al can ##in was recommended for my dog , but since this line of dog food is specific to breed , it was difficult to find in stores . [SEP] [CLS] pets ##mart and pet ##co carried the cock ##er span ##iel formula but only in smaller bags which is much more expensive on a per ounce ratio . [SEP] [CLS] finding a larger bag has been a great deal . [SEP] [CLS] my cock ##er loves the food too ##! ##thi ##s is food especially designed for cock ##er span ##iel ##s who have a range of health issues ... i have been using this product with three of my dogs and all of them are very happy with it . [SEP] [CLS] it also is packaged very well and as a result stays fresh for a long period of time . [SEP] [CLS] great product ##! ##i tired many different dog foods over the 3 y ##rs i have my cock ##er span ##iel . [SEP] [CLS] i then came upon this breed specific dog food & figured i ' ##d try it . [SEP] [CLS] my dog loves this food and always finishes his food . [SEP] [CLS] i ' ##ve used this for over 1 y ##r now & he has not tired of it . [SEP] [CLS] i have seen

[CLS] frankly , i do n ##' ##t care if food is organic , or non ##- ##org ##ani ##c , or natural , or whatever . [SEP] [CLS] i like food that tastes good .

[CLS] great if you are cutting back on fat , they do resemble regular chips but are nothing like them . [SEP] [CLS] extremely dry and hard ##. ##i have never met a kettle brand chip i did not like .

[SEP] [CLS] kettle chips are great chips f ##/ ##the money ##! ##af ##ter buying bags one at a time ( at a he ##ft ##y mark ##up ) at nearby stores , i decided to try bulk ordering some snack foods on amazon . [SEP] [CLS] i was very pleased with the price and the products . [SEP] [CLS] < ##br / ##> < ##br / ##> these ja ##la ##pen ##o kettle chips are not overly spicy ; they have a slow ##- ##building spice that starts very subtly a grows if you eat the whole bag , which i ' ##m embarrassed to say i did quite a few times .

[CLS] these olive ##s were tender , delicious , wonderful quality . [SEP] [CLS] all whole , no b ##lem ##ish ##es . [SEP] [CLS] i used in roasted potatoes w ##/ ##gar ##lic & par ##sley ; pasta sauce , pic ##adi ##llo , & to make spicy herb ##ed olive dishes for christmas . [SEP] [CLS] an impulse buy i will buy again ##. ##rea ##dy as is , or to be finished off as you like . [SEP] [CLS] i put half the bag in a glass jar added fresh garlic , an ##cho ##vy , herbs and lemon . [SEP] [CLS] fine addition to an anti ##pas ##to tray ##. ##while all of the olive ##s were ta ##sty , some were not as " pretty " - ##- but i bought them for the flavor . [SEP] [CLS] i tend to like black olive ##s better than green ; however , the green ones in this package are down ##right outstanding in flavor . [SEP] [CLS] i , too , will buy these again . [SEP] [CLS] they were a " what the heck " purchase the first time ##. ##not my favorite mix ( i like the anti ##pas ##to ones better ) , but these are still very good . [SEP] [CLS] they ship well , but some will be damaged , but you can eat them anyway . [SEP] [CLS] it does n ##' ##t change the flavor . [SEP] [CLS] they just are n ##' ##t as pretty ##. ##i ordered this after realizing my family was buying tiny jars of greek olive ##s at $ 4 a pop and i had all these little glass jars to rec ##y ##cle . [SEP] [CLS] this big bag is a better value and the quality is very good . [SEP] [CLS] not every olive was perfect but more than 90 % is pretty good ##. ##ha ##ving now tried most of the bulk olive ##s on amazon , i can say that these were the most disappointing . [SEP] [CLS] somehow , they managed to get all 4 varieties to taste more or less the same . [SEP] [CLS] i guess it ' ##s the spices they use that mask the subtle differences in flavor between olive varieties . [SEP] [CLS] for a really great bulk olive mix , try the vi ##go mixed olive ##s also on amazon ##. ##i was hosting a large party and decided to get this bulk package from amazon - both for cooking and for serving as apps .

[CLS] these are great ##- ##tas ##ting snack bars , and are even better when you warm them up ( remove from wrap ##per , microwave for 10 ##- ##15 seconds ) , which makes them much softer and smooth ##er , like a treat that just came out of the oven . [SEP] [CLS] they have lots of fiber and protein and nutrients , and plant ste ##rol ##s that lower cho ##les ##terol ##. ##i am trying to watch what i eat , so for breakfast i have a cora ##zon ##as o ##at ##me ##al bar with my coffee and i am satisfied until lunch .

[SEP] [CLS] i have tried other breakfast bars but they were just not as heart ##y and filling as the cora ##zon ##as bars . [SEP] [CLS] cora ##zon ##as has a " just right " taste and texture i love ##. ##i bought these as a health ##ier substitute for the breakfast bars that i usually have in the morning . [SEP] [CLS] the label drew me in , with just the right amount of fiber ##/ ##fat ##/ ##su ##gar for a good start . [SEP] [CLS] the bonus was that , when i tried them , they were delicious .

[SEP] [CLS] they are also a delicious and portable snack for later in the day . [SEP] [CLS] i was alarmed the last time i tried to order and saw they were in short supply . [SEP] [CLS] i hope cora ##zon ##a does n ##' ##t disco ##nti ##nu ##e this flavor , since i think it ' ##s the best one ##! ##i love the cora ##zon ##as peanut butter and banana walnut o ##at ##me ##al bars .

[CLS] bought a set of two when my son was about 6 months , and we started taking them with us whenever we went out to eat . [SEP] [CLS] i cut up can ##tal ##ou ##pe , apple , banana ( even used sweet potatoes a few times ) - ##- just whatever i could get at the restaurant - ##- and it would keep my son busy long enough that i could actually eat ! [SEP] [CLS] it ' ##s great because i did n ##' ##t have to be overly worried about him choking on big chunks , and he got to try out new foods . [SEP] [CLS] i would n ##' ##t hesitate to buy this again ##. ##i have a slightly different version of this - different brand . [SEP] [CLS] my son started using it around six months , and he really enjoys it . [SEP] [CLS] he does get messy if he eats something sticky or juicy like banana or water ##mel ##on , but whatever ... anyway , i also had trouble cleaning it , until i tried scrub ##bing it with a nail or vegetable brush . [SEP] [CLS] it takes some time , but not as much as it would take to run food through a food mill or blend ##er , or cut it up , then clean it up off him , the chair , the floor , the dog , me , well you get the picture ##. ##w ##hat a great idea ! ##! ##! ##!
