the only coconut water that i have found , is n't paturized , is made by exotic superfoods<q>the best way to describe it is fresher and sweeter , without any packaging tastes that the others contain<q>i have had better , but only in bottles from other boutique brands or labeled " raw " but in the bottle  i wo n't even buy naked or one anymore , just to weak and stale , poor remnants of their fresh selves

great stuff.these are the best tasting tortilla chips i have ever had<q>there is so much flavor in these chips that i no longer miss pico de gallo<q>they also have just the right amount of heat to make them flovorful , but not overpoweringly spicy

barry 's bakery french twist is one of the best tasting products on the market and healthy<q>the french twist fits into any diet plan and taste sweet , despite not having excessive amounts of sugar<q>the quality of the twist was its usual good quality , but they would have survived the transport much better if they were in the plastic tubs

you can always add more noodles of your own<q>add sauce to be a wonderful lunchtime meal<q>you can also add sauteed vegetables and tofu for a full meal<q>the citrus flavor is better than the peanut which is too bland

the best dog food on the market today has cleared up since taking this food<q>my cocker spaniel has tried several foods in her 6 years , and this is the only one she will eat by itself without any " people food " being added<q>petco carried the cocker spaniel formula but only in smaller bags which is much more expensive on a per ounce ratio
9
i am very satisfied , product is as advertised , i use it on cereal , with raw vinegar , and as a general sweetner
10
the taste of the tuna was not pleasant , too much basil and other spices for me<q>i found it much tastier than the plain tuna pouches out there<q>there are much better tasting products out there but at 100 calories its better than a special k bar or cookie snack pack
11
you can also go lighter on the tequila if you like<q>try it with your favorite 100 % agave tequila<q>you can use a little less lime juice or add a schmee bit of sugar
12
it 's a great product - especially if you like garlic !<q>there are 150 cloves in every bottle<q>garlic is n't an " oily & salty product " just plain or roasted garlic

among the best milk chocolate candy i 've eaten , ranks with the pricey kind for taste and texture<q>i order these bars because i really like the milk chocolate taste , i will avoid the comparison to the difference in taste between these and other candy bars like hershey<q>i would definitely order from this vendor again when i need my next nestle fix !
14
i like my oatmeal raisin cookies soft , and that 's what these are<q>these are : soft , sweet , chewy , superb . they 're worth it<q>these cookies are individually wrapped and that makes it handy to put them in a lunchbox , backpack , or any portable bag<q>they are great for people who are trying to watch what they eat or are perfect for small hands
15
kettle chips are great chips f/the money!after buying bags one at a time<q>they have a slow-building spice that starts very subtly a grows if you eat the whole bag<q>the price-per-bag was much , much better than any local store could do , although that may play a role in the price difference

for a great bulk olive mix , try the vigo mixed olives also on amazon.i<q>the mix had mostly green olives , quite a few olives were mashed<q>it was n't the first time i bought the bulk olives for christmas

these are great-tasting snack bars , and are even better when you warm them up<q>they have lots of fiber and protein and nutrients , and plant sterols that lower cholesterol<q>they are also a delicious and portable snack for later in the day

i bought a set of two when my son was about 6 months , and we started taking them with us whenever we went to eat<q>i did n't have to be overly worried about him choking on big chunks , and he got to try out new foods<q>i tried scrubbing them out and even washed it in the dishwasher as it suggests<q>the only drawback is that bits of food get stuck in the mesh and the seams and are impossible to get out to save my life
